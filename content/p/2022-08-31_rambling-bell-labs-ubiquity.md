title = "A rambling on the ubiquity of Bell Labs"

I've long been fascinated by the lore of AT&T's Bell Telephone Laboratories â€”
so many fundamental techniques, concepts, discoveries, and inventions
ultimately trace back to them.
I've recently picked up
[Jon Gertner's "The Idea Factory"](http://jongertner.net/the-idea-factory/),
and after that I'll likely be looking for the next piece that can unveil
some more of the inner workings of the behemoth.

Yesterday I was looking to package a third-party Go application for the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)
and someone on #archlinux-aur suggested I use a _clean chroot_
to build the package archive.
I wanted to learn a bit more about `chroot` so I took a quick glance at
its [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot),
where I was greeted by
"Original author(s): Bill Joy, AT&T Bell Laboratories".

Indeed we stand on the shoulders of giants.
