title = 'Thoughts on "The Pragmatic Programmer"'
+++

Shortly after programming became an important part of my day-to-day work, I came across
"How to be a Programmer: A Short, Comprehensive, and Personal Summary" by Robert L. Read;
since then I've read those 30 or so pages multiple times, and recommended it many more.
"The Pragmatic Programmer" struck me as an expanded version of Read's essay.
In fact, as I was sitting down to write this, I noticed it is the
first in a list of book recommendations in the essay's introduction. Huh.

I read the 20th Anniversary Edition and found the book to be great;
the topics are presented clearly, often with amusing and relevant stories.
The authors have condensed their hard-found knowledge nuggets into one hundred
pragmatic tips that should make for a great periodic review checklist.

A couple of ideas that stuck with me:

- In _Engineering Daybooks_, the authors point out the benefits of using and maintaining
  a paper notebook as a journal to record anything related to their work.
  This is a practice that I've romanticized for long but have had no success in
  applying: notes get scattered in code, project documentation, issue trackers,
  chat apps, or never get actually written down.
- In _Assertive Programming_, using assertions _to prevent the impossible_
  is recommended.
  Assertions can be seen as _active comments_, explicitly signaling to readers
  of a piece of code about the assumptions being made by its author.
- In _Power Editing_, the benefits of achieving editor fluency are discussed.
  In the past years I've primarily used VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, and Neovim
  as my editing tools, but I can't really call myself fluent in any of them.
  [John Carmack recently strongly advocated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzr7hRXcwkw)
  for the usage of powerful IDEs and debuggers;
  maybe it's time to give PyCharm a serious spin.
